The PetaBricks project is a collaboration between the
[COMMIT](http://groups.csail.mit.edu/commit/),
[EVO-DesignOpt](http://groups.csail.mit.edu/EVO-DesignOpt/),
and [Applied Computing](http://www-math.mit.edu/~edelman/)
groups at [MIT](http://web.mit.edu/).
These groups are lead by the principal investigators
[Saman Amarasinghe](http://people.csail.mit.edu/saman/),
[Una-May O'Reilly](http://people.csail.mit.edu/unamay/),
and [Alan Edelman](http://www-math.mit.edu/~edelman/).
