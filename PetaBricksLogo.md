# About the PetaBricks Logo #

The PetaBricks logo was custom-evolved using [PonyGE](http://code.google.com/p/ponyge/), an
evolutionary graphics program which generates populations of designs
and allows the user to iteratively select, mate, and mutate them.
PonyGE was developed by [Erik Hemberg](http://ncra.ucd.ie/members/hemberge.html) and [James McDermott](http://www.skynet.ie/~jmmcd).
Our logo was post processed and edited using [Inkscape](http://inkscape.org/) and [Gimp](http://gimp.org/).
The colors are [MIT CSAIL](http://csail.mit.edu) standard to match the CSAIL logo that it is often paired with.
Evolution and design by [James McDermott](http://www.skynet.ie/~jmmcd).

Scalable and higher resolution versions of our logo are shipped with our source code in the directory:
```
